# python-can-netronics

## Description
Interface for [netronics](http://www.netronics.ltd.uk/)' can adapters, namely the [CANdo](https://www.cananalyser.co.uk/cando.html) and [CANdoISO](https://www.cananalyser.co.uk/candoiso.html) devices.

## Installation

```console
pip install python-can-netronics
```

## Extra information
The programmer's manual and all the relative datasheets can be downloaded from [netronics' download page](https://www.cananalyser.co.uk/download.html).

## Compatibility
I developed this library with a CANdoISO device; I don't have a CANdo device to test it, but it should work with it too. There are some minor differences (for example a different clock frequency), but it should still work.
